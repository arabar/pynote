Quickstart
**********

At first you have to create the configfile "noterc" and the data
directory "~/.note". There is a command included to do this.:

   $ note init

* create a new note: "$ note new "spam""

* list notes in a table: "$ note list"

* read a note (use the numeric ID from the table): "note show 1"

* edit a note: "$ note edit 1"

* move a note to trash: "$ note delete 1"

* show trash: "$ note trash"

* restore a note from trash: "$ note restore 1"

* For help just pass "--help" to any command!
