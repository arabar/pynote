Contributing
============

Hacking
-------

Please refer to PEP8 [0] and PEP257 [1]. If you use Sublime Text (3) you
can use the pynote.sublime-project file with the required settings. :)



Pull Requests
-------------

**PLEASE DO NOT USE GITHUB PULL REQUESTS!**

The reasons for that are clearly described by Linus Torvalds in [2].
For submitting patches use git's pull-request generation module(s)
and send the files to stefan@sevenbyte.org to me. Alternatively open
an issue in redmine [3] and attach the patchfiles.

Example:
* Work on the develop or on a seperate feature (or what else) branch.
  Do not mess up the master branch!
* Commit your changes locally.
* Let's say you have commited three times. Do the following:
  $ git format-patch HEAD~3
* Git creates 3 patchfiles with your commit metadata. Send this files to
  stefan@sevenbyte.org or use the bugtracker and attach them. If I like
  your work I will appy the patches with git am. This ensures a very clean
  git history without any strange automatic github commits.
* Furthermore you can commit to your own repo and create a pull request
  with git request-pull.

Hint: I use the git-flow branching model. So look at the develop branch. :)



Commit Messages
---------------

Please use git commit -s to generate a "Signed-off-by: " line. The reasons
are here [4]. Structure your commit message like the following. Write a
short summary of your work and do not forget the blank line. This ensures
that git shortlog (and others) works well.


    Summarize clearly in one line what the commit is about.

    Describe the problem the commit solves or the use case
    for a new feature. Justify why you chose the particular
    solution.

    Signed-off-by: John Doe <john@doe.org>
