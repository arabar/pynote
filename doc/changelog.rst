Work in Progress
----------------



pynote X.X (XXXX-XX-XX)
-----------------------

.. note::

    This section here is used as a roadmap for future releases!

* Fixed tests, switched to pytest and setup travis.
* Git is used via git_wrapper_ to take care of revision control.
* shell completion


pynote 1.0 (XXXX-XX-XX)
-----------------------

.. note::

    I switched pynote to https://pynote.readthedocs.org/ for hosting
    documentation and I switched to github issues as well. There are
    no reasons to maintain my own setup. Every issue ID below this
    entry is obsolte and refer to my old redmine tracker.


* Converted pygments to an optional dependency.
* ``--no-header`` now is a global option.
* Color support! Activate this in your configfile.
* **Big data storage refactoring!**
  JSON files are not used for storing data any more. Simple plain
  text files do the job much better.
  I have created a Gist_ on Github to migrate your data to the
  new format. Please refer to the :doc:`faq` for migrating.
* Pynote now accepts command abbreviations such as ``note l`` for
  ``note list``. This mechanism is handled by click_ and works for every
  command so long as the short command is unique.
* Automatically pass the output through a pager when the output string
  is longer as the terminal height. This could be suppressed with
  ``--no-pager``.
* Migrated the cli interface to the click_ library.
* Prefix all new git tags with 'v' as this is the recommendation by github.
* First read ``/etc/noterc``, then read ``~/.noterc``. The local noterc
  overrides settings in the global one, see `#1`_
* The editor value in your noterc now accepts command line arguments,
  see `#2`_.
* **New configuration option**: ignore_extensions, see :doc:`configuration`.
* **New configuration option**: extensions, see :doc:`configuration`.
* I replaced prettytable with my own - much simpler - library plaintable_.
* Dropped python 3.3 support. I love the new pathlib module!
* Use relative dates with babel_. You have to enable it in your configfile,
  see :doc:`configuration`.
* The numeric note ids are now orderd from 0 to n.
* Removed translation things (for now). If anybody needs this we can
  create a transifex account to involve other people.
* New header design, thanks to Philipp GÃ¶ttlich!
* Removed **note init** command, pynote will do these things automatically.
* Do not include any precompiled files in git. I will create an AUR-package
  with the docs.
* Missing import statement. Now you are informed about a misspelled
  pygments theme instead of a traceback.
* Refactored ``config.py`` to use default values.

pynote 0.2.2 (2014-02-05)
-------------------------

Fixed some problems which especially occured since the last release.

* Fixed a wrong method call, see #370. Thanks to Klaus Seistrup.
* Fixed a problems with ``pynote.init`` and ``pynote.config``, see #368
  and forum posts. Thanks to tonk and null.
* Improved ``pynote.container``. If no data files exist exit and print
  an error message.
* Got rid of git flow, see #369. The errors occured because I forgot
  to bump the version number. Git flow restricted me fixing this trivial
  error with a little rebase.
