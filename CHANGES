pynote 0.3 (XXXX-XX-XX)
-----------------------

Fixed

* Missing import statement. Now you are informed about a misspelled
  pygments theme instead of a traceback.
* Refactored config.py again, see #409.
* Do not use colors by default, see #350.


pynote 0.2.2 (2014-02-05)
-------------------------

Fixed some problems which especially occured since the last release.

* Fixed a wrong method call, see #370. Thanks to Klaus Seistrup.
* Fixed a problems with pynote.init and pynote.config, see 368 and
  forum posts. Thanks to tonk and null.
* Improved pynote.container. If no data files exist exit and print
  an error message.
* Got rid of git flow, see #369. The errors occured because I forgot
  to bump the version number. Git flow restricted me fixing this trivial
  error with a little rebase.
