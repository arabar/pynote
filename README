gempac -- Install Ruby Gems using the Arch Linux Package Manager (pacman)

This project starts as a fork of pacgem. I use it as an education project
for meto learn ruby and to find out how to deploy and manage an open
source project.

It is at very early state in development. DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!!
However, feel free to test and send patches or feature requests to me. :-)
